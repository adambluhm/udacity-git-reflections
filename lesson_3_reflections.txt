LESSON 3 - REFLECTIONS

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    
    It would be useful to create a remote repository when collaborating with
    others as they would need access to the same code. It would also be useful
    for when you are working on multiple computers and need to have easy access
    to your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Being in control of when the changes are synced allows you to ensure that
    any changes are synced in a logical way. Similar to if Git automatically
    committed your changes, many times your work would be in a transitional
    state and any code would likely not work correctly if you are in the middle
    of fixing a bug or adding a new feature. It would be far more logical if you
    had full manual control of when and how frequently the syncing took place.

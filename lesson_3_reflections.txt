LESSON 3 - REFLECTIONS

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    
    It would be useful to create a remote repository when collaborating with
    others as they would need access to the same code. It would also be useful
    for when you are working on multiple computers and need to have easy access
    to your work.

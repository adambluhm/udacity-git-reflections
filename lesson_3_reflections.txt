LESSON 3 - REFLECTIONS

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    
    It would be useful to create a remote repository when collaborating with
    others as they would need access to the same code. It would also be useful
    for when you are working on multiple computers and need to have easy access
    to your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Being in control of when the changes are synced allows you to ensure that
    any changes are synced in a logical way. Similar to if Git automatically
    committed your changes, many times your work would be in a transitional
    state and any code would likely not work correctly if you are in the middle
    of fixing a bug or adding a new feature. It would be far more logical if you
    had full manual control of when and how frequently the syncing took place.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

    Forked repositories are copies of another repository on GitHub. These are
    useful when someone else has made a project available publicly but you are
    not a collaborator and wish to made your own modifications.

    Cloned repositories are also copies of another repository but these exist on
    the same local machine or a local copy of a GitHub repository. These are
    useful when you want to work on your own repository without modifying the
    original repository.

    Branches are different versions within the same repository. These are useful
    when you would like to save a project in a specific state, like keeping
    track of the all of the different public releases of a project, or if you
    want to work on a bug fix or add a feature without impacting the master
    branch.

LESSON 2 - REFLECTIONS

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    A folder named ".git" is created which contains all the repository data.
    This is necessary to create the structure needed for Git to keep track of
    all the changes to the files in the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is a temporary environment of the repository which is a
    representation of a specific state of the working directory. The value it
    offers is that you can make some changes like adding files to the repository
    before actually committing the changes.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
